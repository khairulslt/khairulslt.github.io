title: About me
---

I work on web-development at [UOB Singapore](https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/index.page){:target="_blank"}. 

I enjoy street latin dancing :dancer: - creeping around at developer meetups, competitive gaming, bouldering, trying to be sneaky, python and solving programming problems. I also think I can write well, but truth be told - my writing is as bad as my cooking. I live in the [armpit of Singapore](http://xiaxue.blogspot.com/2005/12/too-many-photos.html){:target="_blank"}

In a previous life, I prepared Science experiments/examinations for both Singaporean and British students in local/boarding schools. I'm competitive. I try to consistently maintain my gaming skills by finishing in top 200 world rankings for Starcraft II & Dota 2 every season.

If something on my [blog](https://khairulslt.github.io) helped you or if you're a junior developer wanting to connect, I'd love to hear from you.

Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/khairulslt){:target="_blank"} or email me at khairulslt@hotmail.sg
