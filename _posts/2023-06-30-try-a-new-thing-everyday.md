My partner came up with a great suggestion for me to discover the world and build new experiences, the concept was simple but the results are phenomenal. Try one thing new everyday and you will inject your adult life with a little of that which you once had an abundance of in your younger years. There is a great article about it already written by the folks over at The Art of Manliness, you can check the link above.


<ul>
  <li><strong>What is the activity?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
  		<li>
  			Check out a new place in Singapore <strong>(Kallang Stadium, I've never been there before, yeah me a local, can you believe that?)</strong><br> Since I decided to go there, I thought, "you know what why not just do a run and do it shirtless?" <strong>(yay go body positivity)</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			Tried Thunder Tea Rice at Laupasat
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>Why do you choose this activity and why haven't you done it before?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
		<li>
  			Kallang Stadium was always near but it was never convenient to go to <strong>(20 minute walk/or by bus)</strong> and I never had a reason to go there <strong>(the gym already has everything i need)</strong><br>
		</li>
		<li>
			Not a lot of places sell Thunder Tea Rice, and I was never into healthy food back in the day.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>How does it make you feel?</strong></li>
	<ol>
		<li>
  			Little bit of adrenaline, got to see the more "polished/touristy" side of Singapore. Caught the sunset which I couldn't enjoy in the moment because I wanted to spend that moment with my partner Olena.<br>
		</li>
		<li>
			Definitely felt way better than eating chicken rice but I have to admit it does have a bit of a duller taste compared to the usual local food unfortunately.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>Would you do it again or would you do it with someone?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
		<li>
  			Alone? For Sure. With my partner Olena? Definitely even more so.<br>
		</li>
		<li>
			No, she would kill me and have my balls for breakfast if I brought her to Lau Pa Sat.
		</li>
	</ol>
</ul>
