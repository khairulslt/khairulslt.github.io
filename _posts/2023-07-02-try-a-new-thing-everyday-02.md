<ul>
  <li><strong>What is the activity?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
  		<li>
  			Try to be physically, mentally & emotionally present for a friend who just broke up (Veron)
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>Why do you choose this activity and why haven't you done it before?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
		<li>
  			I wanted to support a friend by being there for her - using active listening, not just listening and providing anecdotes to make myself feel better about her situation. Asking what she needs, not by drawing examples from my own life to "empathize". But by showing up in the way that they need.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>How does it make you feel?</strong></li>
	<ol>
		<li>
  			At first it was uncomfortable, there was a lot of temptation to chip in with what I know but I resisted the urges.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>Would you do it again or would you do it with someone?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
		<li>
  			Yes, resist the urge to feel in control of a conversation - steer it instead into the person's hands so that they feel in control, it would elevate your way of thinking around people
		</li>
	</ol>
</ul>
