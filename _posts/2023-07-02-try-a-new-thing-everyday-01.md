<ul>
  <li><strong>What is the activity?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
  		<li>
  			Be out the entire day with only 4 hours of sleep and give 90% energy and still utilize your brain (exhibit satisfactory thought capacity) 
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>Why do you choose this activity and why haven't you done it before?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
		<li>
  			I wanted to support my partner by being present physically but also be able to provide the intellectual and emotional support she needs. It was a good way to push past what I thought was my limit in terms of energies that I am able to output.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>How does it make you feel?</strong></li>
	<ol>
		<li>
  			Satisfied and impressed by myself, normally I would want to retreat back home to recuperate especially after lack of sleep & outputting too much energy. This time, I was able to push through and surprised myself by showcasing energy in interactions that I normally wouldn't have.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
  <li><strong>Would you do it again or would you do it with someone?</strong></li>
  	<ol>
		<li>
  			Definitely (within reason)
		</li>
	</ol>
</ul>
